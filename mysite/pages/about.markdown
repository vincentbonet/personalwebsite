# About Me

I am a computer science student in my senior year, with one more semester to go as of this writing. I have been mostly interested in software engineering, but have recently attained a passion for operating systems, as well as cybersecurity. Privacy and customization have been something I've really honed in on, and Linux, specifically the Arch Linux distro, have been tantamount in allowing me to explore this. Cybersecurity is something that I would like to further explore, but have had a hard time as to where to start; however, I will be exploring my options as time goes on.

# About this website 

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. The reason I chose Jekyll was how simple and straightforward it is to input necessary information, and how easy it is for anyone to access what they need to.
